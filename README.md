This repository contains all projects I prepared for the **CT5157 Data Mining** module at the **NUIG**. 

## Project 1
The Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the `Bank` dataset containing data related to direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. The EDA was performed to determine whether a bank customer would subscribe a term deposit or not. <br />
Demonstrated univariate and multivariate analysis of numerical and categorical attributes.

## Project 2
Preparation of the data in the `Bank` dataset. <br />
Demonstrated data preprocessing that included cleaning, feature extraction and selection, preprocessing and encoding of the categorical features, missing data imputation, scaling data with outliers using the RobustScaler.

## Project 3
Clustering and manifold learning - the `Loans` dataset. <br />
Clustering algorithms used: 
* K-Means Clustering
* Birch Clustering 

Manifold learning techniques used:
* Multidimensional scaling (MDS)
* T-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)

Demonstrated selecting the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method and the Silhouette Method.

## Project 4
The comparison of binary classifiers on the `Wheat Seeds` dataset. Classifiers used:
* Support Vector Machine (SVM)
* Random Forest
* K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN)
* AdaBoost

## Project 5
Regression and dimensionality reduction - the `Wine Quality White` dataset.  
Regression algorithms used:
* RandomForestRegressor
* LinearRegression
* KNeighborsRegressor
* AdaBoostRegressor
The dimensionality reduction methods used:
* Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
* Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) with estimator svm.SVR
* Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) with estimator LinearRegression
* Fast Independent Component Analysis (FastICA)
* SelectFromModel with estimator LogisticRegression
